# codeDrills-api

codeDrills-api is the back-end portion of my React Capstone for Thinkful.  For more details on the project,
please take a look at codeDrills-client, also in my github account.  

One difference from my normal projects is that I wound up writing tests *after* I wrote most of the client.
This was a mistake.  But hopefully I've learned my lesson and won't do *that* again!  Anyway, once my tests
for the api are complete, testing the React components will make more sense, and I should be able to resolve many 
of the problems I've been having on the front-end.

Wish me luck!
